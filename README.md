The design of the website flowed from the stated characteristics of the bakery: authenticity, traditional methods, manual work rather than machines, strong and basic values of quality over quantity.

The use of the font reflected manual typewriters, black-and-white photography reflected the simplicty and old-fashioned values, while the use of green text on a few words and buttons created an eye-catching design contrast, plus suggests an organic and environmental ethos.

Discoverabilty is key to my design-thinking, which is why I presented the bakery products in a straightforward navbar rather than a dropdown menu â€“ ease for the consumer is key.

This website is, as of April 19, very much a work in progress. I want to add more functionality and other design embellishments.
